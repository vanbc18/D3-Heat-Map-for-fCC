# D3-Heat-Map-for-fCC
D3 Heat Map for freeCodeCamp Project

This is a heat map that displays the monthly global land-surface temperature between 1753 and 2015.

If you point on any given rectangle on the heat map, a tooltip will display the month and year when the measure was taken, and the temperature variance.

I learnt about the scaleBand() function, which was clearly the best way to finish this project.
